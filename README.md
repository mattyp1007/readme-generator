# readme-generator

## Description
This project is a readme markdown file generator for project repos. It uses JavaScript with Node.js and the Inquirer package to ask a series of questions in the command line to generate a markdown file for any project. It includes many of the sections that are found in any high-quality readme file, including a software license badge and link to the license.
